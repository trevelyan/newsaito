      Saito can help cryptocurrencies like Ethereum scale.
      <p></p>
      Saito-powered payment channels can support an arbitrary number of members, process deposits and withdrawals without closing channels, don't necessarily force users to pay transaction fees, and don't require people to be continuously online. Depending on the use case, channels can also be created that support instant-withdrawals. And upgrading doesn't require a network hardfork.
      <p></p>
      To see a working demonstration of this technology, send an EthLN message to someone and they will receive an invitation to open a payment channel. You can then send funds back and forth once they approve. Please note that this demo does not connect to the Ethereum network. If you would like to see payment channels running on your preferred cryptocurrency and can help with implementation please get in touch. All we need to get payment channels working for any cryptocurrency is basic smart contract functionality.
