<b>Degrees of Gray in Phillipsburg - Richard Hugo</b>
<p></p>
You might come here Sunday on a whim.   
<br/> 
Say your life broke down. The last good kiss   
<br/> 
you had was years ago. You walk these streets   
<br/> 
laid out by the insane, past hotels   
<br/> 
that didn’t last, bars that did, the tortured try   
<br/> 
of local drivers to accelerate their lives.   
<br/> 
Only churches are kept up. The jail   
<br/> 
turned 70 this year. The only prisoner   
<br/> 
is always in, not knowing what he’s done. 

<p></p>

The principal supporting business now   
<br/> 
is rage. Hatred of the various grays   
<br/> 
the mountain sends, hatred of the mill,   
<br/> 
The Silver Bill repeal, the best liked girls   
<br/> 
who leave each year for Butte. One good   
<br/> 
restaurant and bars can’t wipe the boredom out.   
<br/> 
The 1907 boom, eight going silver mines,   
<br/> 
a dance floor built on springs— 
<br/> 
all memory resolves itself in gaze, 
<br/> 
in panoramic green you know the cattle eat   
<br/> 
or two stacks high above the town,   
<br/> 
two dead kilns, the huge mill in collapse   
<br/> 
for fifty years that won’t fall finally down. 

<p></p>

Isn’t this your life? That ancient kiss 
<br/> 
still burning out your eyes? Isn’t this defeat 
<br/> 
so accurate, the church bell simply seems 
<br/> 
a pure announcement: ring and no one comes?   
<br/> 
Don’t empty houses ring? Are magnesium   
<br/> 
and scorn sufficient to support a town,   
<br/> 
not just Philipsburg, but towns 
<br/> 
of towering blondes, good jazz and booze   
<br/> 
the world will never let you have 
<br/> 
until the town you came from dies inside? 

<p></p>

Say no to yourself. The old man, twenty   
<br/> 
when the jail was built, still laughs   
<br/> 
although his lips collapse. Someday soon,   
<br/> 
he says, I’ll go to sleep and not wake up.   
<br/> 
You tell him no. You’re talking to yourself.   
<br/> 
The car that brought you here still runs.   
<br/> 
The money you buy lunch with, 
<br/> 
no matter where it’s mined, is silver   
<br/> 
and the girl who serves your food 
<br/> 
is slender and her red hair lights the wall.

<b>Poseidon - Franz Kafka</b>

<p></p>

Poseidon sat at his desk, doing figures. The administration of all the waters gave him endless work. He could have had assistants, as many as he wanted — and he did have very many — but since he took his job very seriously, he would in the end go over all the figures and calculations himself, and thus his assistants were of little help to him. It cannot be said that he enjoyed his work; he did it only because it had been assigned to him; in fact, he had already filed many petitions for — as he put it — more cheerful work, but every time the offer of something different was made to him it would turn out that nothing suited him quite as well as his present position. And anyhow it was quite difficult to find something different for him. After all, it was impossible to assign him to a particular sea; aside from the fact that even then the work with figures would not become less but only pettier, the great Poseidon could in any case occupy only an executive position. And when a job away from the water was offered to him he would get sick at the very prospect, his divine breathing would become troubled and his brazen chest began to tremble. Besides, his complaints were not really taken seriously; when one of the mighty is vexatious the appearance of an effort must be made to placate him, even when the case is most hopeless. In actuality a shift of posts was unthinkable for Poseidon — he had been appointed God of the Sea in the beginning, and that he had to remain.

<p></p>

What irritated him most — and it was this that was chiefly responsible for his dissatisfaction with his job — was to hear of the conceptions formed about him: how he was always riding about through the tides with his trident. When all the while he sat here in the depths of the world-ocean, doing figures uninterruptedly, with now and then a trip to Jupiter as the only break in the monotony — a trip, moreover, from which he usually returned in a rage. Thus he had hardly seen the sea — had seen it but fleetingly in the course of hurried ascents to Olympus, and he had never actually traveled around it. He was in the habit of saying that what he was waiting for was the fall of the world; then, probably, a quiet moment would be granted in which, just before the end and having checked the last row of figures, he would be able to make a quick little tour.

<p></p>

Poseidon became bored with the sea. He let fall his trident. Silently he sat on the rocky coast and a gull, dazed by his presence, described wavering circles around his head.
